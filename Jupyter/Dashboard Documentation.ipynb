    "- Looked at previous dashboard code to learn what was used and what is needed (libraries and hardware)\n",
    "- Made an official Formula SAE GitHub account to contain and log changes we made to any code that we used\n",
    "- Made a mock-up tachometer to experiment on how to improve it and get more experience with working with Arduino\n",
    "- Experimented with start-up animations for the tachometer\n",
    "- Modified previous dashboard code to omit code that is no longer needed for the new dashboard (such as: 4 digit 14-segment LED displays, tachometer LED-strip clear functions)\n",
    "- Experimented with a PWM driver for controlling brightness on the dashboard display and drive a 7-segment RGB 1\" display for the gear position indicator\n",
    "- Tested 2 warning LEDs for engine temperature and engine oil pressure with PWM driver\n",
    "- Acquired 7-segment RGB 1\" display from Adafruit. Soldered 7 wires connected to PWM driver to test functionality\n",
    "- Acquired 7-segment RGB 1\" display with NeoPixel support from RGBDigit. Simplifies amount of pins required and code (only 3 pins and uses NeoPixel library). No need for PWM driver to control 7-segment display.\n",
    "- Made a mock-up gear position shifter with color matching to tachometer\n",
    "- Updated dashboard code to support PWM driver and 7-segment display. Rough draft ready for testing\n",
    "- Acquired main arduino board, CAN BUS shield, and custom power PCB shield for testing new dashboard code. Made prototype of all wiring to test with dynamometer. See **Dyno To Do Procedure**"
